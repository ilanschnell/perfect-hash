Introduction
============

A perfect hash function of a certain set S of keys is a hash function
which maps all keys in S to different numbers.
That means that for the set S, the hash function is collision-free,
or perfect.
Further, a perfect hash function is called "minimal" when it maps N keys
to N *consecutive* integers, usually in the range from 0 to N-1.
