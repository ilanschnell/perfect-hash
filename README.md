Program for creating perfect minimal hash function
--------------------------------------------------

Generate a minimal perfect hash function for a given set of keys.
A given code template is filled with parameters, such that the
output is code which implements the hash function.
Templates can easily be constructed for any programming language.

Part of the code is based on an a program A.M. Kuchling wrote:

The algorithm the program uses is described in the paper
'Optimal algorithms for minimal perfect hashing',
Z. J. Czech, G. Havas and B.S. Majewski.
